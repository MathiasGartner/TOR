## Project description

"The Transparency of Randomness" is an installation that gives an insight into the world of randomness and its applicability in mathematical models. In twenty-seven transparent cubes floating in space, robotic mechanisms allow random patterns to emerge by rolling a playing dice. In each of the cubes, an internal ramp is covered with different organic materials, thus integrating the complexity of natural environments into the installation. Orange slices, moss, seeds, flowers and many other biomaterials create a unique sound experience through which we can observe the effect of the various irregular surfaces on the falling playing dices.

The collection of random numbers generated by unpredictable dice rolls is the basis for the real-time calculation of pi (ùùø), demonstrating in an impressive way the important role of randomness in scientific research. The artistic installation offers a physical experience of the complex interplay of unpredictability and stochasticity in mathematical and physical research.
